# Main

To create a new project `mkdir hsproj` and cd into it, then `cabal init`. Open the project in editor. Create `/src` folder for source files, and within it a new file `/src/Main.hs` containing:

```hs
module Main where
main :: IO a

module Main where
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello from Haskell!"
```

For a module to work as a `main-is` (in cabal's config) target for GHC, it must have a function named `main` and itself be named `Main`.


The main function must be a computation of type `IO a`    
  `main :: IO a`   

where `a` is a generic type param.    
Often the unit type is used, `a = ()`, and then the type sig is:    
  `main :: IO ()`

Executing the program calls the `main` function.

The `main` function in a non-trivial program is often contained within a wrapper module called `Main`, which only exists to satisfy this purpose. Sometimes shell arg parsing is done via lib like *optparse-applicative*.

For this demo project we have only one simple module, making it just a putStrLn. To validate that everything is working, let's build it and run it. We're going to create a *Cabal sandbox* so that our dependencies are isolated to this project: 
```
$ cabal sandbox init
```

Now that our sandbox has been created, we want to install our dependencies into the Cabal sandbox package-db:
```
$ cabal install --only-dependencies
```

If you install the dependencies before setting up the sandbox, they would be installed into the user `package-db` located in your home directory, which would be global to all the projects on your current user account. Installing dependencies can take some time on first run.

Now weâ€™re going to build our project:
```
$ cabal build
```

If successful, we should get a binary in dist/build/<proj> 

To run it:
```
$ ./dist/build/hello-haskell/hello-haskell
Hello from Haskell!
```


You can also use `cabal repl` to open a REPL and call main like this:
```
$ cabal repl
*Main> main
Hello from Haskell!
```

Note that using `cabal repl` will compile the module as part of opening the REPL, and you can use the same commands you use in your GHCi, such as `:t` to get type information and `:q` to quit.

If everything is in place, let's move on to factoring out some code and
making a separate module that can be exposed as a library.
