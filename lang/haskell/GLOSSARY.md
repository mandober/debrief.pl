## Cabal
*Common Architecture for Building Applications and Libraries* (CABAL) is a framework defining a common interface for authors to more easily build their Haskell applications in a portable way.

The Haskell Cabal is part of a larger infrastructure for distributing, organizing, and cataloging Haskell libraries and tools.

## ghcup

## Hackage
Hackage is Haskell's central package archive that contains thousands of libraries and applications in the Cabal package format.

## Haddock
Haddock is a tool for automatically generating documentation from annotated Haskell source code and is the most common tool used in the Haskell community for generating documentation. Itâ€™s most often used for documenting libraries, although it can be used with any kind of Haskell code. We will not be covering it in detail in this chapter.
