`Functional Programming course`
https://github.com/bitemyapp/fp-course
This is the course we recommend after CIS194 course
This will reinforce and give you experience directly implementing the abstractions introduced in cis194, this is practice which is critical to becoming comfortable with everyday uses of Functor/Applicative/Monad/etc. in Haskell. Doing cis194 and then the FP course represents the core recommendation of my guide and is how we teach everyone Haskell.
