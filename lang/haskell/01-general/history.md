# History

Haskell is a functional programming language, named after mathematician
Haskell Brooks Curry, who made important contributions to mathematical
logic that were used as the basis for functional programming.


Haskell is a statically typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation.

Type classes, which enable type-safe operator overloading, originated in Haskell.

Its main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

Haskell is based on the semantics, but not the syntax, of the Miranda programming language, which served to focus the efforts of the initial Haskell working group. The last stable release was made in July 2010 with the next standard planned for 2020.

Haskell is used in academia and industry. As of September 2019, Haskell was the 23rd most popular programming language in terms of Google searches for tutorials and made up less than 1% of active users on the GitHub source code repository.

Features
- functional: data flows through functions
- pure: functions are pure, without side-effects
- lazy: evaluation strategy is call-by-need
- type system: static, strong, Hindley-Miner

## The Haskell Programming Language

Haskell is named after the mathematician and logician Haskell Curry (1900-1982)

The principal ideas and the design of the language were the work of a committee that met at a conference on functional programming in 1987, and the first definition of the language was released in 1990.

The committee believed that the most useful aspects of various functional languages should be consolidated into a single standard, and Haskell was the result.
